# `arg-enum`

A small, opinionated, written-in-one-afternoon derive macro to make [StructOpt](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt) less of a pain to use with plain enum arguments.

This is meant as a stop-gap until a more standard solution is introduced by the library itself.
Check [this issue](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/106) for newer, better solutions before using this crate.

If you're sure this is your best option, check out [the example](examples/simple.rs) for usage.
